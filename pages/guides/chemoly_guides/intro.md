# Introduction to Chemistry Olympiads
---
> Written by fizzest (Kwanwoo Park), with consideration of Alec Zhu's (IChO '20 Gold) advice document

Competitive chemistry is a competition that puts much more emphasis on your problem solving skills than your depth of knowledge (in comparison to academic Chemistry). That being said, a strong foundation of chemistry knowledge and a lot of practice is necessary to be successful in this event.

In this guide, we will be going over the competition itself, how to study for it, some traps you should avoid, and how to practice!

## About the USNCO

The USNCO (United States National Chemistry Olympiad) is an exam that selects students to participate in the International Chemistry Olympiad. It is a multi-round competition with a local exam and a three-part national exam. 

The local exam is a 60 question, all multiple choice exam that covers the very basics of chemistry. The difficulty of the exam is slightly above AP Chemistry level. You are given 110 minutes for the exam.

If more than two students score above a certain cutline, the top two highest scoring students from each school qualify for the next round, which is known as the national exam. 

The national exam is composed of three parts:
> **Part I** is also a 60 question, all multiple choice exam that is similar in format to the local exam, but much harder and trickier. You are given 20 minutes less than the local exam; 90 minutes.  
>  **Part II** is a 8 question, free response exam. It covers the same topics as Part I. You are given 105 minutes.  
>  **Part III** is a laboratory practical exam that tests if you can properly carry out experiments and draw conclusions from your experimental work. You are given 90 minutes for this exam as well.  

If you do well on the national exam, you can earn the following achievements:
> **Honors** - Top 150 in the national exam, only judging from Part I scores.
> **High Honors** - Top 50 in the national exam, judging from Part I + Part II scores.
> **Camp** - Top 20 in the national exam, you are invited to a camp held every June. This is where you compete for spots in the IChO team. All three parts are considered for Camp.
# Things to Note Before Preparation

## Very Important Things to Be Aware About
---
Before we get into study tactics, there are certain facts that you should always be aware of:

 - You need both high accuracy and speed to be successful, but accuracy is more important than speed.
 - Every question on the Part I exam is worth the same.
 - Competitive chemistry is comparable to puzzles or video games.
 - Under all circumstances, you should never approach competitive chemistry like you would for academic chemistry (chemistry classes you take at school).

If some of these things did not make sense to you, don't worry; I'll explain them one by one in much more detail.

## Competitive Chemistry vs. Academic Chemistry
---
I'll be saying this a lot, but **competitive chemistry and academic chemistry are two completely different things**. 

A common mistake made by many participants is that learning the college chemistry curriculum will aid them in chemistry Olympiad: going out of their way to study physical chemistry and inorganic chemistry textbooks[^1].

Personally, I believe that competitive chemistry focuses **much more** on **problem solving**, rather than your knowledge of advanced chemistry. This also means that you aren't expected to know every trivial reaction or property. You aren't expected to read inorganic chemistry textbooks or any undergraduate textbooks with the exception of the fundamentals.

Here's an analogy: consider your chemistry knowledge as tools. If your fundamental chemistry knowledge is comparable to an all-purpose common tool, such as a screwdriver, then your knowledge of advanced chemistry (such as inorganic chemistry) would be the hard-to-use tools that are very situational.

## Appeal of Competitive Chemistry

Earlier, I claimed that competitive chemistry is very similar to other activities like puzzles or video games. Let me explain why:

When you start a new game, you normally go through a tutorial to learn about the rules. After absorbing the basics, you start playing the game. You find the game pretty enjoyable and want to get better, so you practice until you reach a point when you think you've reached a limit. You can tackle almost any situation that is given to you, but there are certain specific situations where advanced techniques could come in handy. So to become even better, you start to learn new strategies and advanced techniques that might aid you in certain situations. 

This analogy can be applied to really anything: chess, speed cubing, learning an instrument, learning how to code, Lego, and of course, competitive chemistry!

Make sure to keep this ordering in mind, and take all the time you need until you get the hang of each step of the learning process!

Also, one thing I'd like to mention- Chemistry Olympiads tend to be very different compared to your regular Chemistry test in high school.

Unlike the chemistry you learn in an academic setting, good questions in Chemistry Olympiads will be challenging but also interesting, requiring you to think and strategize, instead of mindlessly plugging in numbers into equations (which is a strategy that often works at school, but not in competitive chemistry!).


## Fear

Don't be afraid to try things out! Bombing your first exam is perfectly fine. Bombing your 8th exam is completely fine too. Your rate of improvement will be slow if you only solve easy problems or reading through the fundamentals over and over again. You should always attempt problems **slightly above** your comfort zone to truly challenge yourself.

# Preparation of Chemistry Olympiads

I justified how competitive chemistry is strikingly similar to puzzles and games above. The three steps you'll take for preparation are:

> 1. Foundation
> 2. Problem Solving
> 3. Advanced Knowledge (Optional)

Advanced topics are completely optional, since although the USNCO doesn't require them, they can be very enjoyable to learn at an appropriate time :^)

## Foundation
There are many great textbooks and resources for learning the fundamentals of chemistry. Which one to use depends on your prior chemistry knowledge. Everyone starts differently; some may already have an appreciable background in chemistry (e.g. took AP Chemistry or have a background in physics), but others may have absolutely zero experience. Either way, I have a recommendation for everyone.

> **NOTE:** You should read whatever your reading at least two times, to ensure you do not have holes in your fundamental knowledge.

**For those with an appreciable physics background**: Chemistry is a field that really only applies physics into molecules and substances, so I think people with an appreciable physics background are the most blessed in competitive chemistry :^)

Some of the topics you'll see in chemistry will be very similar to physics. This includes: thermodynamics, atomic theory, and gas laws. 

Of course, the content you learned in physics (for these units) is slightly different in chemistry, but you'll still have a head start compared to others!

The textbook I personally recommend for you is Atkins' Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight. Anything above 4th edition is perfectly fine to use. Even if you don't have any prior experience with chemistry, the _Fundamentals_ section will provide the basic knowledge of chemistry you'll need.

**For those with an appreciable chemistry background**: If you took AP/IB Chemistry at school, Atkins' Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight will be perfectly fine to start with. If you've just finished the course, it might be even possible to skip the _Fundamentals_ section. If you haven't taken a chemistry course in a while, it may be wise to look at the _Fundamentals_ section just as a crash course.


**For those who have Chemistry 1 background or do not have a background in Calculus**: If you just took your first year of chemistry in high school, the book above might be a fairly challenging read, especially if you don't know any calculus.

The textbook I personally recommend for you is Zumdahls' *Chemistry*. Anything above 7th edition is perfectly fine to use. It's a much easier read than Atkins (textbook mentioned above), and covers a decent amount of fundamentals (fun fact: my school use this textbook for our AP Chemistry class).

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/YxzCPAj.png)   

It is highly recommended that you read Atkins after you complete Zumdahl's *Chemistry* for a stronger foundation!

**For those who do not have a chemistry background**: My advice for you is the same as that for the people who have taken one year of high school general chemistry. I personally recommend you read Zumdahls' *Chemistry*. I'm aware that this might be a difficult read especially if this is your first time studying Chemistry, so Khan Academy is not a bad idea as a supplementary resource.

**For those who hate reading textbooks**: With numerous amounts of open educational resources, there are many choices to choose from.

[MIT 5.111](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-111sc-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2014/) and UC Irvine's [Open Chemistry course](http://ocw.uci.edu/openchem/openchem.html) are two great choices in my opinion. Although they are not quite enough for a strong foundation, you can use our NAP notes as a supplement to these lectures, or read the relevant sections of Atkin's _Chemical Principles_.



### Taking Notes

Notes are a preference— you should take them if you’re used to taking them. If you do take notes, however, make sure you actually use them for review! If you don’t, the extra time spent on those notes would be meaningless. The [CODSnotes](http://chem.isodn.org/nap) provided by CODS are an alternative to taking notes on Atkin's *Chemical Principles*.  

### Homework Problems
The purpose of homework problems is to review your fundamental knowledge. They are introductory problems and are not supposed to be challenging (especially for Atkins. If you like analogies, think of them as the tutorial for a new skill you just learned in a game.) You should avoid solving too many of them, as they can be rather harmful (for example, you don't want to be memorizing how to tackle a question! This is a easy trap to fall into especially if you're solving too many textbook problems).

Again, don't be afraid of trying out challenging problems! You should always try out problems that are slightly higher than your comfort level. You can read more about the dangers of solving too many homework problems in [our FAQs section](http://chem.isodn.org/FAQ).

### Scheduling
One of the great things about competitive chemistry (compared to academic chemistry) is that you get to choose your own pace, not somebody else[^5]. Since no one is forcing you to study chemistry, competitive chemistry tends to be much more laid back and enjoyable compared to academic chemistry. 

That being said, one of the worst traps to fall into in academic Olympiads is the trap of over-scheduling.

Making a tight schedule is easy, but the same could not be said for following the schedule. Not only will you be pressured to follow a certain pace which makes the experience much less enjoyable, but you'll probably end up having a sub-par learning experience because you're more focused on finishing your close to impossible tasks for the day rather than absorbing the content. Not to mention, the world is unpredictable. Maybe you got hit by a truck and broke both of your legs, and your schedule is now crumbled into pieces by the randomness of society.

Using the game analogy, I don't think people actually schedule their gaming sessions for the next eight weeks... right?

Yeah, don't do this. You'll lose motivation and pleasure of doing competitive chemistry.

### OK, so I've read Atkins.
Congratulations! You know more chemistry than 99% of people in the world! Blow up the confetti balloon, give yourself a pat in the back, eat a large slice of cake. 

Now clean up the confetti on the ground and apply your newfound knowledge into problems!

## Practice
---
A great place to practice is the past USNCO local exams. They are very doable with Atkins level knowledge and test your fundamentals very well!

I recommend you begin from 2012, as any test before 2012 is practically useless for preparation of the exam..

### Topics on the USNCO
From 2012, all USNCO local and national part I exams have a certain format they follow:
> 1. **Stoichiometry/Solutions** (6): Knowledge of your first-year high school general chemistry is tested.
> 2. **Descriptive Chemistry** (3~5): Knowledge of flame tests, ion colors, selective precipitation, and trivial chemistry is tested.
> 3. **Laboratory** (1~3): Human errors, procedures, and lab equipment knowledge is tested.
> 4. **States of Matter** (6): Knowledge of the three types of matter, phase changes, phase diagrams, IMFs, vapor pressure is tested.
> 5. **Thermodynamics** (6): Knowledge of thermocycles, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy is tested here. Although most questions are calculations, there have always been at least one theoretical question.
> 6. **Kinetics** (6): Knowledge of half-life, elementary reactions (including pre-equilibrium and SSA), integrated rate laws, energy diagrams, and reaction rates is tested.
> 7. **Equilibrium** (6): Knowledge of chemical equilibrium (including solubility and acid-base chemistry) is tested.
> 8. **Redox/Electrochemistry** (6): Knowledge of redox reactions and electrochemistry is tested.
> 9. **Atoms** (6): Knowledge of Atomic theory and periodicity is tested.
> 10. **Molecules** (6): Knowledge of bonding and molecular structure is tested.
> 11. **Organic Chemistry** (5): Knowledge of organic chemistry is tested. All of the questions can be answered with Kleins' _Organic Chemistry_.
> 12. **Biochemistry** (1): There is always one biochemistry question, but it's probably not worth your time to study them.  

The lack of consistency in the questions asked and the different style compared to the modern USNCO exams make exams from 2011 and before, both local and national, not useful for Olympiad preparation.

In addition, tests older than 2017 aren't great representations of the modern difficulty of the USNCO exams, so it is recommended that you save one or two years between 2017 and 2020 so that you can take them before the actual USNCO exam.

Also, make sure once you're done with an exam, don't start a new one but instead spend some time grading your test and obsessing over what you got wrong. Ask yourself what you were thinking when you were solving the question, what you did wrong, and what you could do to prevent this next time.

### Accuracy and Speed
Before we talk about test strategies, let's take some time to discuss about one of the important things to consider:

> * You need both high accuracy and speed, but accuracy is more important than speed.

On the USNCO national exam, you are given 90 minutes to solve 60 questions. This requires you to be fast, but fast isn't really meaningful if you are missing easy questions. When you're practicing, you should put much more focus on reading carefully and solving correctly, rather than solving quickly. You will pick up speed as you gain more experience, but getting accurate is difficult if you only think about trying to complete the test in time. 

Let me rephrase this. As you practice, you start to stack up experience. Everyone uses their previous experiences to make judgements on the question they're looking at. If you have a strong foundation on experience, you'll develop good habits and great problem-solving skills, and you'll be able to identity the question quickly and say "oh! This is kind of similar to (Random question) I did some time ago...."

But if you don't practice properly and focus on raw speed, you won't gain anything..

Don't forget: your goal is to **get the most questions right**, not trying to **finish the exam** for now.

**Every question on the USNCO** Part I exam— easy or hard— is **worth the same**. This means that you should try to consistently get all of the easy questions right, while trying your best to get most of the hard questions. If you're making mistakes on easy questions, it's probably an indication that you aren't reading carefully.

tl;dr: Focus on being consistent rather than being fast! You should try your best to get all of the easy questions right and avoid random mistakes. 

### Time Management
So you're now consistent, but you go way past 90 minutes. This is obviously going to be a problem on the actual exam, but there are ways you can easily improve your speed.

Instead of focusing on trying to solve problems faster, you should try to find a **more efficient way** of solving them. Trying to rush through the process you've been doing can lead to random calculation errors and silly mistakes, so try to be smart and find a better way. 

> Kind of like side-stepping in a kinetics reaction... The world of chemistry prefers a mechanism with lower activation energy rather than high activation energy that results to the same products...  


Another reminder that **every question on the USNCO is worth the same**. This means that you can solve all of the easy questions first and skip the hard ones for later. After you're done, you can try the hard ones. Don't spend too much time on one question; if it takes more than a minute, you should skip it for the very end. With the remaining time, you should check your answers just in case you made any mistakes. And then, you can spend your remaining time attempting the hardest questions.

### Writing Solutions
After grading many tests from CODS competitions, this is a tip especially for when you're practicing for the Part II exam, or IChO exams.

You should think about how you want to present your solution to a problem **before** you start writing. Disregarding this step often leads to a confusing, unorganized solution. Make sure you're writing your solutions neatly, so that the grader can easily understand your solution.

Handwriting is also important. You should not be sacrificing legibility for speed. You don't want the grader to confuse your "7" with a "1". Make sure your handwriting is clear. 

In conclusion, even if it takes more time, you should focus on writing your solutions better, as this will ensure you get all of the partial points you possibly can.

### Practicing with Past Exams
When you're practicing with past exams, it is crucial that you know what you got wrong, but also **why** you got it wrong. You should review your fundamentals, review your thought process, and determine why the other three answer choices are wrong. You learn a lot more from wrong answers than right answers, anyways.

Don't be too obsessed with your score. The score you get on a practice test is absolutely meaningless, especially when you start out. Don't be bummed out because you got a low score, instead you should motivate yourself to become better.

### More Problem Solving Techniques
If you're interested in problem solving techniques, *Problems and Solutions in Introductory Mechanics* by David Morin is a fantastic book, especially if you're also interested in competitive physics. 

Of course, the book itself isn't for competitive chemistry students like us, but the problem solving skills included are so valuable. Luckily, you can read most of the problem solving techniques at [Amazon's preview](https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Solutions-Introductory-Mechanics-David/dp/1482086921/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=morin%20physics&qid=1599678550&sr=8-1).

### After You're Done with Local Exams
If you can comfortably solve local exam questions, then you should definitely step up the level of questions you're attempting. USNCO Part I questions are much more tricky and challenging compared to the Local exam, especially after 2017. You should start with 2012, as the difficulty gap between N2012 (National exam Part I 2012) and L2017 (Local exam 2017) is not enormous.

### Organic Chemistry?
You might have wondered: why haven't you mentioned organic chemistry yet?

Well, the organic chemistry section on the USNCO is an outlier compared to other topics: the questions themselves tend to be easy, as the content dealt with is in advanced chemistry territory.

This section can be prepared by reading the first twenty chapters of _Organic Chemistry_ by Kleins; it is a lot of reading, but also a very enjoyable book, and I can promise you that you will love it. 

### After You're Done with Part I Exams
If you can comfortably solve national part I exams and get consistent scores, then it's probably time for you to practice the part II section of the exam. Again, make sure to think about how you're going to present your solution before you start writing.

### The Part III Section
You can read Allen Ding's guide on the lab section [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uI-AL695yszZqwQxsLmjOanreC-HGHgGCvKvu6b8zs0). 

## Advanced Topics
Recall that you should only be learning these after you have successfully completed the previous two steps.

### Inorganic Chemistry
> ***Miessler's Inorganic Chemistry***: The textbook is compact, concise, and overall provides a decent introduction to the field, although some of its explanations are rather confusing and difficult to understand.  
> ***Housecroft's Inorganic Chemistry***: The textbook is long, detailed, and very dense. Most of its explanations are simple, but it contains a lot of trivial knowledge that isn't required for the Chemistry Olympiads exam.  

### Organic Chemistry
> ***Klein's Organic Chemistry***: well explained, simple, introductory, focused on mechanisms. This is the only organic chemistry textbook that is truly required for Chemistry Olympiads, but might not be sufficient for competitions harder or equivalent to IChO.  
> ***Clayden's Organic Chemistry***: Well explained, detailed, also focused on mechanisms, but also very well organized. This is one of the best books in the field of Organic Chemistry, but very overkill for most Chemistry Olympiads.  
> **Advanced Organic Chemistry Textbooks**: Carey and Grossman are popular, but these are often for graduates and you wouldn't be reading these textbooks for Chemistry Olympiads.  

### Physical Chemistry
> ***Atkins' Elements of Physical Chemistry***: well explained, decent introduction to physical chemistry, and doesn't go into too advanced mathematics. If you are truly interested in this field, you should check out this book. It is the middle ground between _Atkins' Chemical Principles_ and _Atkins' Physical Chemistry_.  
> ***Atkins' Physical Chemistry***: A typical Physical Chemistry textbook that is used by many colleges. Although it isn't very special. Not recommended.
> ***McQuarrie's Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach***: This is infamously known to be one of the best physical chemistry textbooks to be ever written.

### Analytical Chemistry
> ***Harris' Quantiative Chemical Analysis***: For an analytical chemistry textbook, it's a very decent book. It's great practice for advanced calculations (with good practice problems) and is a decent read.
