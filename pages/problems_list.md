## Spring Team Chemathon (CODSCT) '20
Individual Round [S]
The individual round that was used for the 1st CODSCT. Good quality problems, and not too hard to tackle.
Team Round, Pt. 1 [S]
Teams of six were expected to solve this test in one hour. Much harder than the individual round and "wacky in style and kind of unappealing"
Team Round, Pt. 2 [S]
Mainly focused on physical chemistry, but doable with atkins knowledge. All four problems in this set are very challenging.
Topic Round: MasterChef with Nick [S]
All problems in this test are food-themed, but the concepts applied can be solved with Atkins knowledge.
Topic Round: Inorganic-Organic Spectrum [S]
A challenging test that involves a mix of inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry as its theme. The organic problems are rather difficult and may be challenging even for advanced chemists.
Topic Round: Anugrah's guide to USAPhO [S]
A challenging test that is physical chemistry themed. Can be mostly solved with Atkins knowledge, with heavy usage of kinetics, thermodynamics, and some quantum chemistry.
Breaking Bonds Round [S]
Breaking bonds was an event where teams raced against time by solving as many questions as possible while getting them right. The difficulty of the questions increased as rounds progressed.
